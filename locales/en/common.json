    "sbrsp": "Next, the deployment of fleets begins. The classic rules of naval combat say that there should be 4 ships of one cell each (\"single-deck\" or \"single-tube\"), 3 ships of 2 cells, 2 of 3 cells and one of four-deck. All ships must be straight, no curved or \"diagonal\" allowed. The ships are placed on the playing field in such a way that there is always a gap of one cell between them, that is, they should not touch each other either by the sides or by the corners. In this case, ships can touch the edges of the field and occupy corners.",
    "sbg": "The aim of the game is to sink the enemy's ships before they can sink yours.",
    "sbrm": "When the ships are placed, the players take turns making \"shots\", if the cell is occupied by a ship or part of it, this cell is crossed out with a cross and you can make one more shot. If there is no ship in the named cell, a dot is placed in the cell and the turn passes to the opponent.",
    "sbr": "Two players play. Each of them needs a piece of paper (preferably in a cage), a pencil or a pen. The game begins with the preparation of the field. Two squares of 10 × 10 cells are drawn on the sheet. On one of them their ships will be placed, in the other they will \"fire\" on enemy ships.",
    "tttr": "Tic-tac-toe - a logical game between two opponents on a square field of 3 by 3 cells or larger (up to the \"endless field\"). One of the players plays with \"crosses\", the second - with \"noes\". The traditional Chinese game uses black and white stones. Players take turns putting 3x3 signs on the free cells of the field (one is always crosses, the other is always zeros). The first one to line up 3 of their pieces vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins. The first move is made by the player placing crosses. Usually, at the end of the game, the winning side crosses out with a line its three characters (zero or cross), which make up a continuous row. The classic \"tic-tac-toe\" on the 3x3 field is of no practical interest (except perhaps for young children, as the initial stage of learning logic games, or as a simple programming task for student laboratory work) - a well-known algorithm that, if played correctly, guarantees a draw either side, and if the opponent makes a mistake, it allows you to win. Thus, the game is in a state of \"no man's death\".",
    "tr": "The classic playing field of tags is a 4x4 matrix of cells, on which numbers from 1 to 15 are located in order (from left to right and top to bottom). The last cell is empty. The cells are shuffled in a certain way, and the player's task is to restore their original correct arrangement. This can be done only by moving to an empty cell another cell adjacent to it (located to the left, right, above or below the empty one).",
    "fpr": "The main task of this game is to open two identical colors on different cards. A maximum of two cards can be opened. In order to win as quickly as possible, you need to remember where this or that color is located.",
    "chessfield": "The chess pieces are then arranged the same way each time. The second row (or rank) is filled with pawns. The rooks go in the corners, then the knights next to them, followed by the bishops, and finally the queen, who always goes on her own matching color (white queen on white, black queen on black), and the king on the remaining square.",
    "chessknight": "Knights move in a very different way from the other pieces – going two squares in one direction, and then one more move at a 90-degree angle, just like the shape of an \"L\". Knights are also the only pieces that can move over other pieces.",
    "chesspawn": "Pawns are unusual because they move and capture in different ways: they move forward but capture diagonally. Pawns can only move forward one square at a time, except for their very first move where they can move forward two squares. Pawns can only capture one square diagonally in front of them. They can never move or capture backward. If there is another piece directly in front of a pawn he cannot move past or capture that piece.",
    "chessqueen": "The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move in any one straight direction - forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally - as far as possible as long as she does not move through any of her own pieces. And, like with all pieces, if the queen captures an opponent's piece her move is over.",
    "chessrook": "The rook may move as far as it wants, but only forward, backward, and to the sides. The rooks are particularly powerful pieces when they are protecting each other and working together!",
    "chessbishop": "The bishop may move as far as it wants, but only diagonally. Each bishop starts on one color (light or dark) and must always stay on that color. Bishops work well together because they cover up each other's weaknesses.",
    "chessking": "The king is the most important piece, but is one of the weakest. The king can only move one square in any direction - up, down, to the sides, and diagonally. The king may never move himself into check (where he could be captured). When the king is attacked by another piece this is called \"check\".",
